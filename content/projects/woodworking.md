#### Vision 
Building the pictures in my head

Being able to build physical objects means building things that might also have electronics, software, and other interesting ideas in my head embedded in them.

In addition to being a means to that ends, proficiency with these tools and skills has practical benefits around the home.

#### Current Capability
I have the beginnings of a shop going in my basement.

* Table Saw
* Router
* Jig Saw
* Circular Saw

I have built several small things and am slowly building my confidence.

#### Challenges
* Small Space in the Basement
* Dust collection
* Transporting and storing wood
* Time needed to set things up and pack away when finished

#### Abandoned Ideas
(currently none)
