#### Inspiration

Reading books with a small child around can make it difficult to get your imagination lost in a book. I would listen to classical
music with earbuds which would help a lot, but thought about how to take things further.

I remembered some of the mixed reality R&D I did years before and so the idea of using VR/AR to aid ones imagination while 
reading excited me. I did a bit of googling and quickly found others who built similar VR/AR experiences (so I wasn't crazy). 

But none of them had implemented my crazier ideas, probably because VR headsets were just now adding the tools needed to make 
them a reality. I had been wanting to create a compelling VR experience for a while and this felt like the right idea at the 
right timing.
