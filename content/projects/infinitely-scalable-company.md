"The U.S. Is Just Different — So Let’s Stop Pretending We’re Not"
July 2021
Psychology bias towards studying WEIRD countries (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic)
Our psychology models are based on "loose" culture norms.
Tight vs Loose cultures
Tight:
    Strict, ordered. More group think. Respond quickly to crisis in an orderly manner.
    Often countries that have been subjected to regular threats (floods or invaders)
    5 most: Pakistan, Malaysia, India, South Korea, and Singapore
    China, Japan, and Turkey are also tight.
Loose:
    Individualist. More innovation. More open to outsiders.
    Often countries that haven't been subjected to regular threats or have rebelled against prior authority.
    5 most: Ukraine, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, and the Netherlands
    Australia, Brazil and US are also loose.
Chaos Muppet vs Order Muppet
Ernie vs Bert
Basically personal preference towards loose vs tight.
Discussion of the US Navy, which is a tight organization attempting to inject pockets of looseness for innovation.
"The Ultimatum game"
    Giving money to another annonomous person who either has to accept what you give or reject and you both get nothing.
    Most people will offer ~45%

The Stories and Code of Culture Change
Dec 2019
Corporate Culture isn't a set of beliefs its a set of actions.
Values vs virtues
Take onboarding seriously
A new prisoner learns very quickly was is needed to survive in that atmosphere.
People do the same on day-1 of a new job. They look around and see the winners and losers in the company and emulate behavior.
Netflix was worried during the DVD days that a streaming company would come along and eat their lunch.
So they started the streaming piece (always the plan) and kept all the DVD people out of the high up exec meetings.
People were mad but it was needed to establish a path forward.
