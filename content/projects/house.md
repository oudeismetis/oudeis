My current home project is 3D modeling a new addition
<!--more-->

#### The High Level
I have been on a slow journey to transform my house into the kind of home where I can engineer all sorts of things.
    * Woodworking
    * Metalworking
    * Electronics
    * Home Automation
    * IoT
    * Robotics

I started by replacing an old oil furnace with [Geothermal]({{< ref "geothermal-install.md" >}}).

Then I fished cat6 [through my walls]({{< ref "fixing-pc-bottleneck.md" >}}).

That led me to adding my own server rack. (post coming)

So I could better host some of my side projects (ex: [missed-moment]({{< ref "missed-moment.md" >}}))


#### Home Addition

Just started...update soon.
