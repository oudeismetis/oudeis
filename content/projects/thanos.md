Transmitter works. Payload is mostly built. Will have an accurate weight soon, which will determine 
the balloon and parachute we purchase. Hoping for an August launch window.

#### What is it
"Terrestrial High Altitude Nautical On-Sight", my first attempt at a near-space high altitude 
balloon.  
I created a "space program" at work and have several talented engineers working on this as a side project.

#### Current Capability
Radio transmitter sending GPS location via the APRS network.  
GoPro camera for recording video to burst altitude.  
Internal schelving insert structure for easy packaging of launch day payload.

#### Challenges
In principal, this is an easy project. Attach a cheap cooler to a weather balloon and let it go.  
But there are a number of issues you quickly discover.  
- Living in the DC region means a lot of restricted airspace to think about.
- High Altitude weather patterns can drastically affect when and where you can launch.
- The best and cheapest way of tracking the payload requires a HAM radio license.

Most of these challenges have been met. Myself and another teammate got our HAM radio licenses.  
We've built and tested a working APRS transmitter.  
We've done a lot a research on launch locations, times, etc.
Just need to finish building the payload, weigh it, and begin final calculations.

#### Abandoned Ideas
None so far. We've kept the project rather MVP.  
Goal is the track and recover the payload. Camera and altimiter on board to capture images from 
burst altitude (and to know how hight that was).
Thats it for this first launch.

#### Inspiration
Always wanted to "send something to space"

#### Research
TODO - LOTS of links to share
