#### What is it
"Start with why"

#### Current Capability
Start by dropping in all the 3D renders you've done over the years.
Perhaps dump all of them into a blog post instead and when you start modeling again, reference that post from here?

FYI: The robot models I made long ago are in the "my-old-passion-for-robotics" draft blog post.
