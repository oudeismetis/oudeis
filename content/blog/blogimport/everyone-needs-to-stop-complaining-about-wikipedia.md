Sources:<br />There was an NPA discussion a while back.<br />Read several articles over the past years.<br />http://news.slashdot.org/story/14/07/30/137234/an-accidental-wikipedia-hoax?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed<br /><br />http://xkcd.com/978/<br />http://www.dailydot.com/lol/amelia-bedelia-wikipedia-hoax/<br />http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/07/20/how-pranks-hoaxes-and-manipulation-undermine-the-reliability-of-wikipedia/<br />http://news.slashdot.org/story/14/12/21/2310201/librarians-the-google-before-google?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed<br /><br />Core points:<br />In the olden days, people had the same EXACT problem with trusting scientific books. It's why journals were invented. Yes, anyone can make up a fact, add it, promote it so others pick it up, cite those sources as proof, and complete the circle of myth. Yes, this can also happen accidentally. But this also accidentally happens outside of wikipedia as well. How many "facts" were we raised on that didn't stand up to peer review in the lab. I'm sure there are loads of assumed truths that have found their way into countless encyclopedias and scholarly works. (http://www.vox.com/2014/7/10/5884093/this-scientific-journal-just-had-to-retract-60-papers-how-on-earth and is it increasing? How much is accidental retractions? http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111005/full/478026a.html) In that sense, wikipedia it a petri dish for what has been going on for hundreds of years. Our lack of trust in wikipedia has helped us to find and call out these mistakes. I think that's a good thing. Perhaps this same level of rigor should be applied to all the wisdom we take for granted in our school system. Hey, we could crowd source it. Classrooms everywhere could each choose/claim a specific niche topic from a book they are studying. The class will then spend time fact checking, reproducing results, and chasing sources back to their creation point. Sort of "knowledge archeology". 99.99% of classes will probably verify things are accurate, and will have learned a little something about research in the process. But I'm willing to bet a very small percentage will raise a red flag on something that doesn't quite add up. Others can than pick that up and double check things. The end result might be the discovery of several core assumptions that are flawed in knowledge base.<br /><br />*************<br />This has been happening FOREVER. I won't touch on religion too much, but here is one example:<br />The Catholic church retranslates some things from latin:&nbsp;http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/04/mass-confusion/<br />(I'm sure the very devote could come up with dozens of examples where they think other religions "got it wrong" and vice versa. Of course this is also the problem with ancient history.)<br />*******************<br /><br /><br />The only difference today is that knowledge moves faster and permeates deeper on the internet. Wikipedia makes it very easy to invent facts and, if not corrected quickly, become a permanent part of the internet. This is the one point I don't have a strong argument for. This is the one aspect of the internet that can be dangerous. I do have a weak argument though. Those same facts can be quickly corrected and those corrections can just as easily spread fast and deep on the web. The same can not be said for dead tree scholarly works. Once it's on paper and published around the world, it is very difficult to undo.<br /><br />In the end...it really does not matter.<br />This is why professors in school always required me to find several independent sources. Nothing on it's own is trustable. Wikipedia is a GREAT starting point for research. But it's only the beginning. You have to dive into the references, the references within the references, and try to find a couple of independent works built on pure research. Nothing is different here. A student who cites Encyclopedia Britannica is just as bad as one who cites wikipedia.<br /><br />It's not just wikipedia...<br />...new things on internet != worse than dead trees...<br />...stop complaining, start improving.<br /><br />
