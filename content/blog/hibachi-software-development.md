The extra effort tastes better

## Setting the table

Often when you build software there is a hungry consumer waiting impatiently, checking their watch and elevating their own expectations of what is to come.

Building anticipation can result in a big let down, and a hangry client sending an app back to the kitchen. It's also not fun to be called out of the kitchen to be asked about status/tickets/outcomes/etc while something is burning.

Often all you really want to do is skip all the meetings and "get back to cooking", but there is an opportunity awaiting the savvy engineer in those regular meetings with the right approach.

## No pictures on the menu

Imagination can result in unrealistic expectations, or fan the flames of fear. Showing them a perfect picture of what they might get can be a huge let down later if the kitchen doesn't deliver.

I worked at a haunted house in my teens, building optical illusions before the Holloween season, but also as a performer. You learn that everyone is afraid of something different, but everyone is afraid of a dark room as they fill that empty space with their own personal fear. 
```

Use design sparingly. (But they can also help right?)

## Give them an App(etizer)

Even if all you can do is create an account and log in, it's something to wet their appetite. I often find little things like using their logo and colors or simply configuring the domain/DNS with the URL is enough to get them excited and ready for what is to come.

## Dinner and a show

They thought they were just here for a hot dog stand transaction, but now you are giving them a 5 star experience that will stay with them as a great memory.

```
There was once a daycare owner who was frustrated at parents arriving late to pick up their kids. The owner decided to implement a late fee. The result? Parents started showing up even later because the owner accidentally turned a social and interpersonal problem into a transactional one.
```

When you make something an experience and, common in the case of software projects, and journey and a quest of discovery and invention, you bring them along as a collaborator. If a boat captain has a charter to go fishing, but the fish don't bite, there was still enjoyment to be had by the paying customer. But if the customer is a resturant on the main land, they only pay for caught fish.

(TODO - gif of the fishman lecture from jaws? Or some other crustly old explorer being chartered. Maybe Han Solo?

## Teach them to fish

People inheritenly understand the value of education. If they leave you feeling wiser and smarter, they will put a cost premium in their mind on what working with you is worth to them.

(TODO - gif of SNL tech support don't teach me joke)

But be careful not to take this too far. Don't force feed them information they don't have the stomach for. Just be open, and let their questions and interests guide what you share. This also only works if they are already feeling satisfied with the meal, so make you are already delivering on their core needs.

(quote: "If you can't explain something simply you don't under stand it well enough")

No one wants to be lectured about how corn is farmed or hear a long winder tale about the hardships of farmers. But they do want to experience some emotion about the hard working farmer and the smell of fresh cut grass.

# Compliments of the chef

There are so many things we build in software because we always end up having to build them anyway. HTML email, user notifications/reminders, email alerts when new users sign up or take an important action, etc. These little things are often forgotten about during initial planning, but come up much later on. Make a show of it. It might take 2 seconds for you to pull in that feature from a past project, but it's still a new feature. Show it off to them and gently remind them that it wasn't in the scope of work, but you knew they would need it so you just did it.

# Be a storyteller
Your patron (the one giving you money) has come to you for more than food (your code). They want an experience, entertainment, and maybe become smarter/wiser through the process.
# Antici. . .pation
Is actually a bad thing. Don't build up the future in their minds as it'll never live up to reality
(sooo. . .don't be a storyteller? Different kind of story maybe)



# Work in the open

daycare money transactional story
project lead emotion
collab vs transactional
feeling like you have a partner

help the client feel the pain of the devs

what should you show the client when and to what purpose?

clients think some things are easy that are hard and vice versa

mis-alignment of shared understanding

kinda ties into iterative development as the best way to solve misalignment is to have a built thing in our shared hands to discuss (as opposed to a demo or wireframes or just a plan)

PyCon 2024 - Story telling ‼️ as a role we have when getting clients on board with our process


Call out scope creep and implied requirements. Moving something from excel into an app. . .and a bunch of excel features were implied
