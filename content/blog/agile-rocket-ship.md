"Start with why"
<!--more-->

Waterfall - SLS Orion or Boeing Starliner (pick one)
Agile - Spacex Starship

Talk about the history of building a rocket. Perhaps show a timeline of start and delivery gates as well as project delays.
Show how far along things are given just how LONG development has been happening.

Then....show how quickly SpaceX has built their ships.
Video or gif showing all the explosions and failures.
Release this after their (hopefully) successful test launch of Starship in Fall 2021.
