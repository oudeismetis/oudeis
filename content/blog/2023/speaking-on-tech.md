**Trying to work more in the public**
<!--more-->

TL/DR [Streaming Here](https://www.twitch.tv/thinknimble) Wednesday's from 12-2PM Eastern

Honing my ability to execute at speed as an engineer has been something I've focused on for a long time now. But I've has less practice at the human side things. (Coaching engineers, mentoring non-technical founders, marketing, sales, etc)

Working with [ThinkNimble](https://www.thinknimble.com/) for the last 2 years has helped me to further develop these skills as I build and launch startups for non-technical founders.

As I developed my voice and codified my experience/wisdom, I noticed I was repeating myself many times to clients, so I began to slowly record and publish my thoughts.

Below are a few examples.

### Streaming on Twitch:
Working on my startup ideas and other projects in public is one way I can slowly do marketing for my ideas as I bring them to life. (Waiting for something to be done to sell/market it is never a good idea)

I've done a couple of test streams already, but will begin streaming more regularly now.

My hope is **every Wednesday from 12-2PM Eastern**, but my schedule has been difficult lately.
