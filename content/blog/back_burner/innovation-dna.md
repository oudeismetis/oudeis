"The key to successful innovation, though, is the pace at which it happens."

I'm a big believer in making sure innovation is part of company DNA. I think we are quickly headed for a future where you can't just have one innovative moment and milk it for decades. Nor can you expect one executive at the top to have all the good ideas. Too many companies get so focused on efficiency and scaling that they accidentally kill all innovative thought.

Innovation is a muscle every individual has that can atrophy if unused. Your entire company should be flexing it weekly/daily. Doesn't mean you are creating something brand new, just that you are keeping the skill fresh in your brain.

As you grow as a company, do you have a plan for maintaining innovative thought?
