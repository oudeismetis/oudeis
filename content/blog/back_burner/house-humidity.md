Start with why
This is a multi-year experiment and post
<!--more-->

# TODO:
* ~11/21 - Start kill-o-watt recording of humidifier if Judy installs it (week by week cost through the winter?)
* ~4/22 - Start kill-o-watt recording dehumidifier (week by week cost?)
* ~6/22 - Conduct dehumidification experiment below

Powering and refilling a humidifier in winter
Powering and listening to a dehumidifier in summer

There has to be a better way?

Heat pump water heater
  * Exhausts cool dry air in summer
  * Experiment:
    * Daily: Record humidity levels indoors and outdoors. Record weather report (rain, humidity)
    * Weekly: Record kill-o-watt dehumidifier costs
    * Week 1: vent to basement 
    * Week 2: vent to outside
    * Data check: repeat for more weeks if data is too noisy

Clothes Dryer
  * Exhausts warm moist air in the winter
  * There are heat pump versions that don't exhaust at all
  * Can be vented indoors, but lint is a problem. Devices exist but are of questionable quality
  * Experiment:
    * House humidity better after house renovation?
    * First winter - kill-o-watt cost of humidifier for the season if still using it
    * If deemed worth it, buy and install indoor vent system with seasonal split
    * Second winter:
      * kill-o-watt cost of humidifier
      * track house humidity and air quality, both near source of exhaust and far away

Clothes Dryer research:
Was thinking about how we will be venting the cold dryer water heater air into the basement in the summer and thought why can't we
do that for the hot wet air of the dryer in the winter?

You can and there are devices for it.

Problem:
Lint and too much moisture for small spaces

I wonder if a dust deputy or a MERV 11 dust sock bag would solve the lint issue?
Ideally this would vent to the basement. Will need to look at the plans to see if there is a way to send it down there.
Seems too far away from the unfinished area of the basement. Hmmm. . ..

Conclusion:
Look into heat pump dryers that don't vent at all and are a lot more efficient. 
    Typically smaller at ~4 cu ft. (vs ~7 cu ft for normal dryers). At that smaller size they are ~$1100 vs $900 for a decent
    dryer. Normal capacities are $1400+
    Try to plan for it, but wait until the house is built and check humidity levels in basement before building this.
    If low humidity is a problem, then perhaps have a smart home diverter that only does this when humidity is low.
