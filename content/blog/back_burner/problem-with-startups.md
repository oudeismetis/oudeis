"Start with why"
<!--more-->

Problem with startups:
* pitching VCs
* HR
* payroll
* your logo

No space for the introverted inventor

# The Bell Labs Mistake
Success was measured by patent generation.
R&D with wild and great, but lacked direction and rarely turned into real products.

# 10% time is like Bell Labs
I do think Bell Labs is a better starting point.

* You need the discipline of scheduling 4 hours a week to work your idea
* You need to start by actually building something

# Hypothesis driven development is the next stage

* Build something that will validate your assumptions
* Prove that your ideas have potential, and are more than just ear worms

# Selling your idea
You can spend years in just 10% time if you want to and I'd say there is nothing wrong with that. You may even succeed at getting 1 or 2 individuals to organically see the brilliance of what you are doing and help you out on it. But at some point you will be ready for more. Either more people or more time. Both are a capital investment.

At this point you need to be able to do one of these:
* Articulate your vision by speaking
* Present your ideas well with visuals or writing
* Have a built Alpha version that is compelling

You don't need to do all of them, but having two is probably wise. In either case, showing your past hypothesis and what you've learned from them is CRITICAL.
The point here is that you've made the future less cloudy. Others should now be able to see what you have seen for a while now.
At a minimum, success here would mean you either get more of your time (20% instead of 10% lets say) or you get more people who want to spend their 10% time helping you.

# Product Market Fit is stage 4
You've used 10% time to prototype some ideas, you've learned some hard lessons from your hypothesis, and you now have more time/people to dedicate since you've made the future less cloudy.

Sometimes profit isn't the point of what you are building. But whatever the goal is, you want it to be sustainable. Something that can continue on even after you stop showing interest in it yourself. This is product market fit. Whatever it is your idea gives to the universe, if it's valuable the universe should be giving you something back (even if that return is other people volunteering their time). That ROI needs to be enough to keep the engine going. Eventually, it needs to be enough to keep it going potentially forever.

# Traditional coaching in stage 5
You are building the thing. People want the thing. The return is greater than the investment, even if all returns are being sent back into this machine you built.
At this point, you have a growing business/non-profit/movement/etc. From here traditional coaching can be used to help you solve the niche problems you are facing as you take this thing to 11.
