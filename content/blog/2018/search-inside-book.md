Experimenting with mindfulness approaches to life's experiences.
<!--more-->

Balancing work and family is never easy. With this book, I'm hoping to strengthen my attention and 
focus. To have more thoughtful answers to questions, especially the crazy ones my toddler throws 
at me.

Most of it involves exercises I've read about before, but there is one that I've found very 
compelling so far. It involves sitting down with another person. One person speaks for 3 minutes 
about anything they feel like, while the other person attempts to have 100% mindfulness on 
everything they are saying and doing. Then swap. Listening with a focus on truly hearing the other 
person, and with no expectation/plan to reply to them. Only accept the words they are saying. 

Sounds like a very fun and interesting exercise to me.
