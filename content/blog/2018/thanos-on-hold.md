It's hard to launch a High Altitude Balloon after October
<!--more-->

We were pretty much ready to go for an August launch, but then ran into. . .shall we say. . .project management issues.

Now into the month of November it's pretty much impossible for us to launch (without getting a hotel in West Virginia) as the high altitude winds will be pushing the payload too far east. 

Hopefully we'll get a chance to resurrect the project in 2019.
