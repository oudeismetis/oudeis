A mostly finished side project from 2017. Feeling newly motivated to finish it off.
<!--more-->

The initial build had hard-coded a single blender file. I had started implementing an account system 
so users could upload their own and call them from the API. That effort was left half finished. I 
plan to finish that off this summer and possibly open source the code.
