Made a down payment on an expensive Geothermal system - then my AC died, cat had health issues, water in basement, and laid off from work.

## "Don't Fear the Reaper"

I threw myself a brief pity party - but then I sucked it up, put on my war paint, and spent a couple of months slowly fixing my life's issues. It has served as a valuable reminder and lesson.

We spend our lives fearing hardship. As children we are regularly reminded of how hard it is to be an adult. It's used as a pressure point to remind us to stay in school and work hard so we can live the easy life when we get older.

Some of us succeed at that. If you're lucky enough to have a strong network of family and friends, you might even go through your entire life avoiding all but minor hardships. If you're really lucky maybe your kids will as well.

## "Fortune Favors the Prepared Mind"

But why live in fear of something that is likely inevitable? Why not embrace it?

Seek out life's challenges. When life starts to feel normal/boring/easy, find a way to add a little chaos. Learn and grow in many diverse ways. So when life throws you a little chaos that you weren't expecting, you'll be ready for it.

If nothing else, when your children face large obstacles, you will know how to support them and encourage them to thrive in a harsh environment. They will be better for it.

Life is not about checking the clock to see when you can finally stop trying. It is about [sucking out all the marrow of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5kBt9IvIQ).

Learn to love hardship and greet it as an old friend when it comes around. Set an extra dinner plate for it every night just in case. Don't complain or worry when it arrives. With time, your fear will subside and you will be all the happier for it.
