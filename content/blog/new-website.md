Life got in the way of blogging, but I never stopped working on projects. So this site is going to 
focus more on projects, with the occasional blog post sprinkled in.
<!--more-->

I'm going to attempt to take an open source approach to my project thought processes.  
As I start new projects I'll immediately create a project page and use it to document and work 
through problems as I solve them.  

I think there is value in not just sharing the polished finish product, but also in sharing the 
challenges and stumbles along the way.
