"Start with why"
<!--more-->

My brain has been swirling with a lot of ideas.

* Outfeed table
* Mobile dust cart rolled up to any tool
* Mobile power for other tools (powers on when tool powers on?)
* Downdraft table at one end
* Pull out hose for targeted cleaning
* Pull out power cord
* Blast Gates on 2+ sides
* Quick release dust bin
* Robotic blast gates?

Problem:

PVC pipe coming out the top of the dust deputy is too tall to make the table height match other work surfaces.
Raising the wheels up into the cabinet would help...but that would require the table to be wider.
Also, adding all the PVC 'Y's, couplings, and other things would also be tight, so table probably needs to be longer.
Now considering 24X48 or 24X36.

Lessons Learned:

As long as your patient, a hair blow dryer works great for heating up PVC to be molded.
