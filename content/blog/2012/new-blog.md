<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; text-align: left;">After starting a blog multiple times and changing my thoughts/opinions on how a blog should be run, I'm starting over from scratch. I will start by slowly be seeding content here with some old good posts. However, The main purpose of this blog will be for me to track and document my accomplishments, and will also serve as a way for me to share some of the more interesting projects I've been working on.</span>
