Why it's good:<br />http://www.inhabitots.com/biodegradable-wooden-lego-bricks-stack-up-to-sustainable-play/<br /><br />Idea: if the patent system ever gets reformed and patents are allowed to expire more quickly, this could be a good strategy:<br />A year or two before it's expected to expire, seek out and partner with "parallel market" companies that might want the patent. License it for free to them and help them innovate new products. That way, when it does expire, you'll still control your niche and it'll be harder for random companies to come in and compete with you directly. (Your partners will protect your adjacent markets for you.
