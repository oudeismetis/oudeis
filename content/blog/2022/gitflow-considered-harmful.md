A quick reference guide to help teams move away from Gitflow
<!--more-->

I've noticed a lot of dev teams still use GitFlow and i've found myself repeating the same arguments against it enough times, that I finally sat down and put together a consolidated guide. I think the easiest way to cover the topic is with a history timeline.

Sharing the timeline below should serve as a good primer before a team sits down to discuss the pros/cons and make up their own mind.

***

#### 2010: GitFlow was [initially proposed](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

It quickly became the standard that every engineering team followed

#### 2015: The "[GitFlow Considered Harmful](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful)" blog post was published

It triggered a bit of a dust-up among devs online, resulting in the author [writing a 2nd post](https://www.endoflineblog.com/follow-up-to-gitflow-considered-harmful)

Since then it seems that most dev teams have abandoned GitFlow

Many still hold to it and in some places it's still referenced as the standard

#### 2017: The "considered harmful" author proposes "[OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow)"

Some time later [Github](https://githubflow.github.io/) and [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) basically copied this idea

Over the years several [articles bashing GitFlow](https://georgestocker.com/2020/03/04/please-stop-recommending-git-flow/) also popup (one example here)

#### 2020: Author of GitFlow [updates his article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to discourage GitFlow

There are still cases where it's useful, but not for most modern dev teams.

#### 2021: "Considered Harmful" author writes "[OneFlow on GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab](https://www.endoflineblog.com/implementing-oneflow-on-github-bitbucket-and-gitlab)"
