In the coming months, the frequency of my blog posts will likely slow as I have decided to leave my employer and move to NYC as I begin work for a tech start-up called <a href="http://www.socure.com/">Socure</a>.

Before signing off, I will share a few thoughts I have had as I reflect on this life event...<a name='more'></a><br /><br />I must say, I owe a lot to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>.<br /><br />My father was heritage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Aerospace">GE Aerospace</a>. I remember being 6 years old and attending a Christmas party at the King of Prussia facility. I remember moving to Bucks County PA&nbsp;because of his work and hearing the words "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Marietta">Martin Marietta</a>" at the dinner table. Little did I know that when I chose to major in<a href="http://ist.psu.edu/about"> IST at Penn State</a>, I would later compete for an internship at Lockheed because&nbsp;<a href="http://ist.psu.edu/directory/HansenM">Marc Hansen</a> had a hand in the creation of that major.<br /><br />And while interning and working in the same exact room my father had worked in 20 years before, I would then be offered to join the company in it's Engineering Leadership Development Program.<br /><br />I would enter my senior year of college with a job in hand. A job that was going to pay for my master's degree and provide me the opportunity to work on 12 different projects at 5 work locations in 3 states.<br /><br />And while working on one of those projects, I would meet <a href="http://cherryshoe.blogspot.com/">a wonderful engineer</a> whom I would later ask to marry me.<br /><br />Yes...I owe a lot to Lockheed. Almost every stage of my life has been impacted by that company.<br /><br />//insert "Time of your Life" Green Day song here<br /><br />However, like a child eager to move out of his parents house, I have longed for the opportunity to strike out on my own and test my skills with a nimble and agile&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;company. Hearing rumors that sequestration may soon hit my current program angered and scared me at first, but I quickly resolved to turn it into the catalyst I needed to make that leap of faith.<br /><br />Sequestration handed me lemons, so I am going to make lemonade...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/NyLUU3O4zW8/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/NyLUU3O4zW8&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/NyLUU3O4zW8&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><br />
