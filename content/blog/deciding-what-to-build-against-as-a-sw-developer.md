<br />I'm not saying don't use new tools, but you should definitely make decisions deliberately. To that point, below is something I said to a development team on a project a few years ago:<br /><i>"We're not going to build this to be compatible with IE6 because, even though most of our users are using it today, very few will be when the tool gets rolled out in a year. So we should 'functionally' support IE6 and 'fully' support IE7 and later."</i><br />
