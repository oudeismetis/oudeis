Making Serious progress in 2025
<!--more-->
---

After picking up and putting down this project many times over the last couple of years, 2025 is the year I'm looking to finally
make it happen.

There have been two big motivators that should make this true:

1. Meta announced last September that they will finally be opening up the Passthrough Camera API (which is actually available now)
2. I recently started [my own company]({{< ref "new_company.md" >}}) and am carving off some dedicated time to work on projects like this one

### Summary of new Accomplishments

* Brand new Godot 4.3 project with the latest Godot XR tools
* Meta XR Simulator integrated into Godot
* Simple VR app where you can click a button that triggers an action
* gdExtension to call my own C++ code
* [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) library imported and callable from Godot
* Displaying OCR'd text inside the game after pressing the button
* Improved OCR quality, fixed bugs, added logs, etc, etc.

### Struggles

Getting the Tesseract library installed was a HUGE pain.

In hindsight it all makes sense now, but that's because I learned a lot about how to work with C++ libraries (knowledge I haven't
had to tap into for over 15 years).

Hopefully progress will move a LOT faster now.

I hope to show big jumps in progress on this project in 2025.
