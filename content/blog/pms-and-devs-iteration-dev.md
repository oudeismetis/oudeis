**"Start with why"**

### The Problem with Traditional Dev Shops

Traditionally, development followed a linear path: a lengthy planning and discovery phase led by PMs, followed by handing off requirements to engineers for implementation. There isn't a shared "why" within the team. Direction is more command-and-control as engineers are treated like children, with developers treated as mere executors of tasks without much input into the product's direction or user needs. 

Apathy and disconnection results as team members learn to not question decisions and just do what they are told.


### Embracing Shared Ownership and Understanding

Iterative development, however, necessitates a more collaborative dynamic. **Engineers have a "seat at the table"**, their insights and expertise valued alongside the PM's product vision. This collaborative approach necessitates:

* **Shared Understanding of Outcomes:** Both PMs and developers must focus on the desired outcomes of the product. This involves understanding user needs and aligning development efforts with achieving those goals.
* **PMs Thinking About Development:** PMs need to have some understanding of development constraints and possibilities to effectively guide the iterative process.
* **Developers Thinking About Product:** Developers need to engage their "empathy for the end user" and consider product implications when making development decisions.

### Benefits of Continuous Dialogue

**Regular check-ins and discussions** between PMs and developers are crucial for flushing out potential issues and ensuring alignment.  These conversations can lead to:

* **Deeper understanding for developers:**  PMs can provide context and nuance that developers might not have considered, leading to more informed development decisions.
* **Course correction for PMs:** Developers might offer perspectives that highlight flaws or oversights in the product plan, leading to necessary adjustments.

This continuous feedback loop helps **mitigate the risk of building the wrong thing** and ensures that the final product meets both client expectations and user needs. 

The sources advocate for **outcome discussions** to happen regularly: internally between the PM and the developers on a weekly basis, and with the client on a monthly basis as outcomes approach production readiness. This frequency ensures that any disconnect or misunderstanding is caught and addressed early in the process, avoiding costly rework and frustration later on.

The Problem with Traditional Dev Shops
In a traditional setting, engineers are often given a list of features to build, with little emphasis on the "why". This can lead to a disconnect, where engineers don't engage with the product's purpose or the users' needs
. Essentially, engineers are asked to turn off their brains and simply build, which is a huge waste of their talent
.
The Power of Iterative and Hypothesis-Driven Development
With iterative and hypothesis-driven development, engineers gain a seat at the table
. Their insights and wisdom become valuable for the client. This means that both the PM and the lead developer work as a team, combining their knowledge to solve product challenges together. It requires the PM to understand a bit of the development process, and the developer to think about the product
.
How This Shift Changes the Engineer's Role
•
Empathy for the User: Engineers are encouraged to consider the end-user experience and empathize with their needs
.
•
Product Thinking: Engineers are asked to engage their product-oriented minds and share their perspectives
.
•
Collaborative Partnership: Rather than just executing tasks, developers are encouraged to partner with the PM
.
•
Shared Understanding: This collaboration ensures that both the PM and dev understand the goal of their work
.
The Benefits of Product Thoughtwork
When engineers share their concerns or insights, there are two possible outcomes:
1.
Deeper Understanding: The PM can clarify why a feature is important, providing the engineer with a deeper understanding of the product's direction
. This knowledge influences how engineers architect their code, as they can identify which pieces are temporary and which will have long-term implications
.
2.
Product Improvement: The engineer's viewpoint may reveal a flaw in the PM's understanding, leading to a necessary adjustment of the product strategy or further investigation of user needs
. This type of collaborative conversation flushes out bugs, edge cases, and nuances, and ensures the team is building the right product
.
Why Shared Understanding Matters
Without this collaboration, there's a risk of the team building the wrong product
. Relying solely on the PM's vision and the engineer's execution creates a disconnect. This can lead to situations where the final product doesn't meet the client's needs or the user's requirements
.
Outcomes-Focused Approach
Our goal is to have these outcome-focused discussions on a regular basis
. Rather than waiting until the end of the project to assess results, we have weekly meetings between our internal PMs and developers, and monthly discussions with the client as outcomes get closer to being ready to go to production. This ensures that we make small course corrections along the way and maintain a shared understanding of what we're building and why
.
Conclusion
By encouraging engineers to engage in product thoughtwork, we create a more collaborative, efficient, and user-focused development process
. This shared effort ensures that the product development process isn't just about building features, it's about understanding the "why" and delivering real value to the users.
