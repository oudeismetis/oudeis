<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: x-small;">Yea, DB migrations are always fun as you'll never know what migration hell you're going to run into until you try. I assume it should be fairly easy to build a model.py from an existing WP table structure. As long as you're using the same DB type, it should be a straight forward export/import.&nbsp;I can't imagine you guys have too much data to worry about. Are you guys hosting/maintaining some of your customer's applications for them? Or do you mostly just finish a project, make sure they've deployed it properly, and then leave the customer on their own?</span><br /><div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></div><div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Slightly off topic, I found it odd that Django doesn't let you update models. Once it's created, your only option is to destroy it and create from scratch. Luckily v1.7 (probably production ready later this summer) will finally let you migrate. It'll also support python 3.4 when it comes out.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.<wbr></wbr>com/en/dev/topics/migrations/</a></div><div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">If you skip past the beginning sections, they are also adding support for some data migration utilities.</div><div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></div><br />"Python's answer to Ruby on Rails"<br /><br />What I like about Django:<br /><br /><ul><li>Built in lightweight DB and webserver for fast prototyping.</li><li>Admin dashboard by default for your customer to include content and copy.</li><li>No reloading of the webserver. Most changes don't need a reload.</li><li>Like any good framework, it makes the repetitive tasks easy and leaves the developer to focus on the complicated bits. But Django has taken it a step further...</li><li>I love the module building.
