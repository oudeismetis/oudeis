CTOs and tech leaders I've met over the years.
One in charge of application network security, but didn't know how the internet works.
A CTO who demanded weekly SQL dumps because didn't know what an ORM was.

Vibe coding will lead to a future where there are more of these over-confident tech leaders who don't have a real understanding of how things work.

## Alternative blog post
"How to approach vibe coding as an engineer"
Lets assume it's going to "Take your job".

1. Lean into what is hard
1. Breadth not depth
    - Jack of all trades will be the new norm
    - Getting 90% good at something is only a few prompts away
    - The 2nd 90% still requires experience, mistakes, and the wisdom that comes with them
1. Depth not breadth
    - Anything that is easy for you is now easy for everyone
    - Anything that is hard for you, but easy for others with more experience is now easy for you
    - But there are hard things that are just hard. Lean into those
1. Focus on outcomes
    - There are no more cogs in the machine
    - Maybe you could focus on your small piece of the puzzle. Someone else spoke to customers. Someone else handled strategy,
      support, sales, marketing, etc. Only a few select skip level managers had the full picture.
    - Orgs will be smaller and flatter now. You might still avoid sales or talking to users. But you'll now sit next to the person
      who does. What used to be a team of engineers will now just be you.
