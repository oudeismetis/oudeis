Learning lots of engineering lessons along the way
<!--more-->

I started this project [a little over a year ago]({{< ref "starting-woodworking-bed" >}}) as a way to hone by building skills as a
stepping stone to some of my more ambitious IoT/robotics project ideas.

After a couple of months of steady progress, things stalled out as I reaching the sanding stage of the project.

Sanding turned out to be a more [exhausting]({{< ref "air-quality" >}}) problem than I anticipated.

It's loud, takes a long time, numbs your hands,. . .irritating and it gets everywhere.

But I slowly powered through and was able to sand away all of the minor flaws and tool marks.

The side rails also got built since [my previous update]({{< ref "starting-woodworking-bed" >}}).

They were hard to make, but also a lot of fun as an engineering challenge.

I had to make a template on a drill press to keep my hand straight as I drilled the deep holes for the long carriage bolts.
Given the length of the long bolts I needed to make sure they would go in straight.

I then used a spade drill bit to start two holes next two each other. I used a chisel to unite those two holes and make one end
flat (see above). I then used a straight router bit to dial in the depth I needed. Deep enough for a washer to fit over the bolt,
but not too deep as to go all the way through. (An extra 1/4" would have been disaster) I repeated this process 8 times for the 8
bolts needed to attach the two side rails to the end frames.

I also used the router to notch out resting spots for the slats on the side rails.

Applying Boiled Linseed Oil was a messy, but enjoyable process.

The [grease monkey]({{< ref "tesla-hitch" >}}) returned to help me tighten the bolts when the bed was ready for assembly.

I was a little worried about stability and movement, especially if a grown adult was playing around on it. But as things came
together my fears subsided as this thing feels VERY solid!

I was very happy with how everything turned out.

Things look even better with the bed made.

## What's Next

As you may be able to infer from the picture about, the original design was for the bed to be more of a bunk bed with space 
underneath for playing, reading, etc.

In an effort to finish the project sooner (and alleviate fears around the stability of my first real project), I opted to focus on
the version you see pictured here.

After taking a break from the project, I'll work on building safely rails and a third stability side rail so that the bed can be
switched between it's current setup and the bunk bed variant.

Not sure when that will all happen though. . .:smile:
