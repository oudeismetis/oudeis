14 years of soccer, 6 years of rugby, countless years of distance running and I still have a gut and love handles.<br /><br />Truth is, of all my brothers, only one has ever had a 6 pack and he had to go through basic training in the army to get it.<br /><br />We've called in genetics, but part of my never believed that cop out. For me, it was more convenient to just blame school and work. I'd train for 6 to 9 months and get in really good shape, but then life would get busy and I'd lose it. In my entire life, I have never trained and stayed in shape for more than 9 months straight.<br /><br />I told myself that when school ended that would change. Well.....school is out and I'm faced with the moment of truth.<br /><br />I know I can do it. In the past I had gained weight from school/work and have been up to 220 lbs. I've then succeeded at working it off and taking myself back down to 195. (my plateau since high school)<br /><br />The question is: can I do better than that?<br /><br />Armed with past knowledge/wisdom and a copy of the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_4-Hour_Body">4 hour body</a>, I am committed to find out.<br /><br />Results to follow...<br />
