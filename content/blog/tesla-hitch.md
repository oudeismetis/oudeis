The most expensive things I've ever disassembled...
<!--more-->

...in addition to being the most expensive car I've ever owned by far. (I hail from Camry/Civic people)

When we bought the car a year ago to replace our aging Honda Civic, I asked our daughter to name the car. She chose..."Civic".
 (TODO - pic of car title in menu here)

Despite also owning a large CRV, it has since become our vehicle of choice for every trip we do, including vacation road trips and weekend biking/hiking outings.

As such, it was about time we put a hitch on this car to expand our cargo capacity.

# Up on the Blocks

So, you cannot actually summon a tesla up onto blocks. It'll get about 1/3rd the way up before stopping. So I had to do that the old fashion way.

(TODO - wheel on block picture)

Of course I waiting until after I got the car up on the blocks to ask the question:

"This car is like 4x the weight of a gas car right? Can the blocks support it?"

They can, it was fine. (might have been an issue if all the weight was on one block alone)

# Taking things apart


# Installing the hitch

# Everything back together

# Impact to range?

The full hitch is 43lbs
The detachable stealth piece is 6.5lbs
