I finally have all the supplies needed to launch
<!--more-->

It's frustrating to take a project to 90% completion only for all progress to grind to a halt for 2 years.

That is sadly what happened to this project. I was working on it with some coworkers but then left the company in July 2018. There was still a plan to do the launch, but time dragged on and we missed the favorable window for summer high altitude winds.

Luckily I have finally re-acquired all of the supplies and am in a good position to launch this year.

Remaining steps:

- Take a complete inventory to make sure I do in fact have everything
- Do a dry run assembly and test of all the equipment
- Find a couple of people to help with launch day (I can't do this alone)
- Dry rehearsal as a team
- Make arrangements to purchase helium
- Draft a launch notice for airports/FAA
- Start daily/weekly tracking of NOAA high altitude wind reports
- Pray for a nice calm summer Saturday

Now that I look at it there is still a lot of work to be done. It is probably a good idea to keep the question mark in the title of this post.
