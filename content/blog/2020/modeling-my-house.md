We've been thinking about improving our home. Perfect time for a 3D model!

I've reached the point where bigger construction changes are needed. So I recently spent some
time modeling the house. Below are some of the fruits of that labor.

I went with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as I have a good amount of past experience with it, it's open source, and I love that it's entirely Python, complete with scriptable hooks into most/all functions (that's a future post ;)

When modeling a fixed structure like a house, it's best to start by measuring everything and creating a 2D floorplan. You can then import that into blender and create all of the 2D walls on top of it. (Hard to see, but in the picture below I've modeled on top of the walls)

You can then extrude those walls out into the 3rd dimension.

Things can get chaotic quickly, so I found myself doing some organizing, a Blender feature I hadn't needed much in the past.

This led me to some interesting perspectives of my home, like being able to "see" where the geothermal pipes and wells actually are.

I was also able to generate schematics to send to architects, a useful power I now have as designing a home with an architect in the middle of COVID-19 is tough.

Finally, I started playing around with my own architectural ideas. (I have a lot to learn, but I'm sure [Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_(M._C._Escher)) would be proud)

Now that I can see through all of my walls, onward to bigger challenges!
