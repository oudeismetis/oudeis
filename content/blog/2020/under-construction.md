For this website, 2020 is going to be a rebuilding year.
<!--more-->

I never stopped building things (the picture above is from my backyard), but life got busy and I stopped keeping track of my projects.

One of my goals for 2020 is to get back to tracking projects in a more "open documentation" way.

I have more than enough content; here's hoping I have the discipline to keep my notes here instead of a random notebook or text file.
